### Prompt 1 - Pete's Surf Shop

**Overview**
Hey I'm Pete, and my companies website - Pete's Surf Shop is in a serious need of a facelift! We are trying to break into the digital space, until now we have only been a small surf shop that served our local community. We recently have ran into some real success which gave us the funding to reach a larger digital audience

**Company Branding**
We want our website to be totally rad dude! We enjoy big bold exciting text that really screams fun in the sun and also calls attention to our new products, Like woah.

We need imagery that makes people want to get in the water and get totally pitted dude - [Totally Pitted Dude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ckCAUVOn0).

While we want our imagery to draw our users in to buying our product we need the website to focus mainly on the products we are trying to sell. The typography and imagery just needs to draw our fellow surf bros in but ultimately we still need to be able to make the sale.

We do have a design in mind but feel free to like, totally modify it dude if you feel like you can make it fit our style better - that would be totally rad.
